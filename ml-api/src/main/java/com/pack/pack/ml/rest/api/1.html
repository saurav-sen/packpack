Brathwaite's over produces five runs as Pakistan captain Sarfaraz Ahmed gets off the mark with a boundary to fine leg. Brathwaite will consider himself unlucky to have not had a wicket&nbsp;as Shimron Hetmyer dropped Babar Azam early in the over. Pakistan are 50/3 after 11 overs.</strong></p>\n       <span class=\"ptime\">15:49 (IST)</span>\n       <p>Brilliant over from Andre Russell. He's been the pick of the bowlers in the early exchanges and has now bowled a wicket maiden in his third over. He's got two wickets and Pakistan are 45/3 after 10 overs.</p>\n       <span class=\"ptime\">15:47 (IST)</span>\n       <p><strong>WICKET: Andre Russell has struck again!&nbsp;This is becoming a statement like performance from him here in Trent Bridge. It's another bouncer that has Haris Sohail jumping all over the place and he edges it to Shai Hope.</strong></p>\n       <span class=\"ptime\">15:43 (IST)</span>\n       <p>West Indies have brought on Carlos Brathwaite into the attack and he's on the money first up with a good over. Just the three runs from two scoring shots for Haris Sohail. Pakistan move onto 45/2 after 9 overs.</p>\n       <span class=\"ptime\">15:40 (IST)</span>\n       <p>Russell showing his worth early on here in Trent Bridge. The field given to him is an attacking one and he is bending his back here against the two new men at the crease. They've managed just the couple of singles and aren't taking a chance with Russell. A third wicket could cause panic in the dressing room. Pakistan are 42/2 after 8 overs.</p>\n       <span class=\"ptime\">15:37 (IST)</span>\n       <p>Cottrell&nbsp;this time keeps Babar Azam from taking runs off him, but is unable to keep the new man Haris Sohail quiet.

Pakistan move onto 40/2 after 7.&nbsp;</p>\n       <span class=\"ptime\">15:32 (IST)</span>\n       <p>That's an impressive over from the veteran Russell. He's just conceded the couple of runs and taken an important wicket. Pakistan are 35/2 after 6 overs.</p>\n       <span class=\"ptime\">15:30 (IST)</span>\n       <p><strong>WICKET: West Indies turn to the experienced Andre Russell and he's taken five deliveries to make a difference. Quick bouncer at Fakhar Zaman that hit's him on the head and then rolled onto the woodwork. Pakistan are two down.</strong></p>\n       <span class=\"ptime\">15:26 (IST)</span>\n       <p>Babar's played a majestic drive through the mid-off region off his second ball of the World Cup for a boundary! Some start he made before playing out four dot balls and taking a couple of runs at square leg of Cottrell. That's taken the score to 33/1 after 5 overs.</p>\n       <span class=\"ptime\">15:22 (IST)</span>\n       <p>Fakhar is enjoying batting in Trent Bridge and he's finding the boundary with some ease here. He's crashed Holder through the point region for a boundary to start with before driving him through the covers for three runs. He's been joined by Babar Azam, who's opened his account off the first ball with a three in majestic fashion.&nbsp;Pakistan have moved on to 27/1 after 4 overs.&nbsp;</p>\n       <span class=\"ptime\">15:17 (IST)</span>\n       <p>Fakhar at the other end is taking the aggressive route and found a boundary of Cottrell earlier in the over before Imam was dismissed in what was eventually a six run over.&nbsp;</p>\n       <span class=\"ptime\">15:16 (IST)</span>\n       <p><strong>WICKET: West Indies have struck early on through Sheldon Cottrell who has Imam caught behind down the leg-side as he tries to play the big shot towards fine leg.

Live streaming for the game is available on Hotstar.\n       <br>\n       <br>\n       <strong>PREVIEW:</strong> Just a couple of years back, Pakistan had stunned the cricketing world (as they often have in their long history) by winning the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy in England with a win over arch-rivals India in a dramatic final. No one gave the Pakistanis any chance, heading into the final after India had hammered them by 124 runs in their previous meeting in the same tournament.\n       <br>\n       <br>Sarfaraz Ahmed’s side will need to draw on the same inspiration when they begin the ICC World Cup campaign against the West Indies at Trent Bridge on Friday as rank-outsiders, much like their opponents. The current ICC ranking — Pakistan are 6th while West Indies are 8th — don’t tell the whole story about this potential explosive encounter.\n       <br>\n       <br>The Windies are buoyed by the return of Chris Gayle and Andre Russell into their line-up for the tournament. Russell, especially, has fond memories of facing Pakistan after smashing a blazing 13-ball 42 in the two side’s last encounter in the 2015 World Cup.\n       <br>\n       <br>The all-rounder is coming on the back of a fantastic season for Kolkata Knight Riders, where he smashed sixes at will. He carried the same form into the warm-up games, smashing 54 off 25 balls against 2015 World Cup runners-up New Zealand.\n       <br>\n       <br>West Indies have set off the warning bells even before the World Cup can get under way by posting 421 in the warm-up game. Trent Bridge is a venue which has seen big totals aplenty with England posting 481/6 and 444/3 in the last three years. 500 will be their next target if Shai Hope and Carlos Brathwaite are to be believed.\n       <br>\n       <br>“If you are asking me if we are capable of it, definitely we are,\" Brathwaite said. “However, in a real game you probably won't have the depth in batting at 10 and 11 that we had in warm-up game. So you need to be a little real about the target.”\n       <br>\n       <br>Pakistan will be wary going into this tie knowing that their bowlers failed to defend in excess of 350 in the last few ODIs against England.\n       <br>\n       <br>“We will seek inspiration from our Champions Trophy win because then also we were losing and then lifted ourselves at the right time to win the trophy,” Sarfaraz told AFP ahead of the game in Nottingham.\n       <br>\n       <br>“The boys are motivated and are eager to put these losses behind them and by playing in England for a month we are well prepared and you will hopefully see us doing well,” the Pakistan skipper, one of Pakistan’s only two survivors from the 2015 World Cup along with Haris Sohail, said.\n       <br>\n       <br>\n       <strong>Last Five ODIs</strong>\n       <br>\n       <br>West Indies: WLWLL\n       <br>\n       <br>Jason Holder’s side had mixed results in the tri-series in Ireland also featuring Bangladesh. The side though is bolstered by the return of Gayle, Russell and Carlos Brathwaite from their IPL commitments.\n       <br>\n       <br>Pakistan: NRLLLL\n       <br>\n       <br>They lost the ODI series against England 4-0 even after posting impressive totals in all the ODIs.\n       <br>\n       <br>\n       <strong>Players to watch out for</strong>\n       <br>\n       <br>\n       <strong>West Indies:</strong>\n       <br>\n       <br>\n       <strong>Andre Russell:</strong> A lot of people believe him to be Windies’ X-factor in the World Cup. 510 runs in IPL-12 came at a strike-rate of 204 while a whopping 52 sixes. He has carried on this form into the warm-up games. On Trent Bridge’s flat track, Russell will be waiting to explode.\n       <br>\n       <br>\n       <strong>Pakistan:</strong> Babar Azam: If Russell is master-blaster, Azam is the master-accumulator. The young Pakistan batsmen is the fulcrum around which the Pakistan side revolves with an average of 51.67 in 64 ODIs with nine centuries already.

Brathwaite's over produces five runs as Pakistan captain Sarfaraz Ahmed gets off the mark with a boundary to fine leg.

Pakistan are 50/3 after 11 overs.</strong></p>\n       <span class=\"ptime\">15:49 (IST)</span>\n       <p>Brilliant over from Andre Russell. He's been the pick of the bowlers in the early exchanges and has now bowled a wicket maiden in his third over.

Pakistan move onto 45/2 after 9 overs.</p>\n       <span class=\"ptime\">15:40 (IST)</span>\n       <p>Russell showing his worth early on here in Trent Bridge. The field given to him is an attacking one and he is bending his back here against the two new men at the crease. They've managed just the couple of singles and aren't taking a chance with Russell. A third wicket could cause panic in the dressing room. Pakistan are 42/2 after 8 overs.</p>\n       <span class=\"ptime\">15:37 (IST)</span>\n       <p>Cottrell&nbsp;this time keeps Babar Azam from taking runs off him, but is unable to keep the new man Haris Sohail quiet.

Pakistan move onto 40/2 after 7.&nbsp;</p>\n       <span class=\"ptime\">15:32 (IST)</span>\n       <p>That's an impressive over from the veteran Russell.

Pakistan are 35/2 after 6 overs.</p>\n       <span class=\"ptime\">15:30 (IST)</span>\n       <p><strong>WICKET: West Indies turn to the experienced Andre Russell and he's taken five deliveries to make a difference.

Pakistan are two down.</strong></p>\n       <span class=\"ptime\">15:26 (IST)</span>\n       <p>Babar's played a majestic drive through the mid-off region off his second ball of the World Cup for a boundary! Some start he made before playing out four dot balls and taking a couple of runs at square leg of Cottrell. That's taken the score to 33/1 after 5 overs.</p>\n       <span class=\"ptime\">15:22 (IST)</span>\n       <p>Fakhar is enjoying batting in Trent Bridge and he's finding the boundary with some ease here. He's crashed Holder through the point region for a boundary to start with before driving him through the covers for three runs. He's been joined by Babar Azam, who's opened his account off the first ball with a three in majestic fashion.&nbsp;Pakistan have moved on to 27/1 after 4 overs.&nbsp;</p>\n       <span class=\"ptime\">15:17 (IST)</span>\n       <p>Fakhar at the other end is taking the aggressive route and found a boundary of Cottrell earlier in the over before Imam was dismissed in what was eventually a six run over.&nbsp;</p>\n       <span class=\"ptime\">15:16 (IST)</span>\n       <p><strong>WICKET: West Indies have struck early on through Sheldon Cottrell who has Imam caught behind down the leg-side as he tries to play the big shot towards fine leg.

Live streaming for the game is available on Hotstar.\n       <br>\n       <br>\n       <strong>PREVIEW:</strong> Just a couple of years back, Pakistan had stunned the cricketing world (as they often have in their long history) by winning the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy in England with a win over arch-rivals India in a dramatic final. No one gave the Pakistanis any chance, heading into the final after India had hammered them by 124 runs in their previous meeting in the same tournament.\n       <br>\n       <br>Sarfaraz Ahmed’s side will need to draw on the same inspiration when they begin the ICC World Cup campaign against the West Indies at Trent Bridge on Friday as rank-outsiders, much like their opponents. The current ICC ranking — Pakistan are 6th while West Indies are 8th — don’t tell the whole story about this potential explosive encounter.\n       <br>\n       <br>The Windies are buoyed by the return of Chris Gayle and Andre Russell into their line-up for the tournament. Russell, especially, has fond memories of facing Pakistan after smashing a blazing 13-ball 42 in the two side’s last encounter in the 2015 World Cup.\n       <br>\n       <br>The all-rounder is coming on the back of a fantastic season for Kolkata Knight Riders, where he smashed sixes at will. He carried the same form into the warm-up games, smashing 54 off 25 balls against 2015 World Cup runners-up New Zealand.\n       <br>\n       <br>West Indies have set off the warning bells even before the World Cup can get under way by posting 421 in the warm-up game. Trent Bridge is a venue which has seen big totals aplenty with England posting 481/6 and 444/3 in the last three years. 500 will be their next target if Shai Hope and Carlos Brathwaite are to be believed.\n       <br>\n       <br>“If you are asking me if we are capable of it, definitely we are,\" Brathwaite said. “However, in a real game you probably won't have the depth in batting at 10 and 11 that we had in warm-up game. So you need to be a little real about the target.”\n       <br>\n       <br>Pakistan will be wary going into this tie knowing that their bowlers failed to defend in excess of 350 in the last few ODIs against England.\n       <br>\n       <br>“We will seek inspiration from our Champions Trophy win because then also we were losing and then lifted ourselves at the right time to win the trophy,” Sarfaraz told AFP ahead of the game in Nottingham.\n       <br>\n       <br>“The boys are motivated and are eager to put these losses behind them and by playing in England for a month we are well prepared and you will hopefully see us doing well,” the Pakistan skipper, one of Pakistan’s only two survivors from the 2015 World Cup along with Haris Sohail, said.\n       <br>\n       <br>\n       <strong>Last Five ODIs</strong>\n       <br>\n       <br>West Indies: WLWLL\n       <br>\n       <br>Jason Holder’s side had mixed results in the tri-series in Ireland also featuring Bangladesh. The side though is bolstered by the return of Gayle, Russell and Carlos Brathwaite from their IPL commitments.\n       <br>\n       <br>Pakistan: NRLLLL\n       <br>\n       <br>They lost the ODI series against England 4-0 even after posting impressive totals in all the ODIs.\n       <br>\n       <br>\n       <strong>Players to watch out for</strong>\n       <br>\n       <br>\n       <strong>West Indies:</strong>\n       <br>\n       <br>\n       <strong>Andre Russell:</strong> A lot of people believe him to be Windies’ X-factor in the World Cup. 510 runs in IPL-12 came at a strike-rate of 204 while a whopping 52 sixes. He has carried on this form into the warm-up games. On Trent Bridge’s flat track, Russell will be waiting to explode.\n       <br>\n       <br>\n       <strong>Pakistan:</strong> Babar Azam: If Russell is master-blaster, Azam is the master-accumulator. The young Pakistan batsmen is the fulcrum around which the Pakistan side revolves with an average of 51.67 in 64 ODIs with nine centuries already. Azam was in top form against England with 115 and 80 in the last two ODIs and also added a century in the warm-up game against Afghanistan last week.\n       <br>\n       <br>Team News/Availability:\n       <br>\n       <br>\n       <strong>West Indies:</strong> Fast bowler Shannon Gabriel was the only injury concern in their squad after limping off in their rained-out warm-up game against South Africa. But he has been cleared of injury although he didn’t feature in the second warm-up game.\n       <br>\n       <br>\n       <strong>Pakistan:</strong> While there was a question mark over Mohammad Amir's availablity, the skipper Sarfraz Ahmed has made it clear that the left-arm paceman is fully fit and will be available for selection.\n       <br>\n       <br>\n       <strong>Squads:</strong>\n       <br>\n       <br>\n       <strong>West Indies:</strong> Jason Holder (capt), Fabian Allen, Carlos Brathwaite, Darren Bravo, Sheldon Cottrell, Shannon Gabriel, Chris Gayle, Shimron Hetmyer, Shai Hope (wk), Evin Lewis, Ashley Nurse, Nicholas Pooran, Kemar Roach, Andre Russell, Oshane Thomas.\n       <br>\n       <br>\n       <strong>Pakistan:</strong> Sarfraz Ahmed (c), Fakhar Zaman, Imam-ul-Haq, Babar Azam, Shoaib Malik, Mohammad Hafeez, Asif Ali, Shadab Khan, Imad Wasim, Haris Sohail, Hasan Ali, Shaheen Afridi, Mohammad Amir, Wahab Riaz, Mohammad Hasnain. \n      </div> \n     </div> \n    </div> \n   </div> \n  </amp-live-list>\n </article>   \n</section></body></html>
