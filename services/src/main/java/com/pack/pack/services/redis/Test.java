It is in the backdrop of this, we have undertaken a study in the Army headquarters for restructuring the headquarters within. How do we then ensure that the social media platform becomes an important adjunct of our information warfare strategy. Do we need a Directorate General of Information Warfare?\\\\\"Can we amalgamate some of our existing resources and ensure that social media becomes a part and parcel of our life in the Army.\\\\\" Rawat said.Armed forces personnel are not encouraged to use smartphones because of the sensitivity of their job.Referring to this, Rawat said if the usage of smartphones cannot be prevented then at least the individual should be taught how to use it in the right manner.\\\\\"If you want to bring some discipline, then you (should) have the means of imposing that discipline. In case, there is no means to impose that discipline, then it is of no use passing order and instructions which can be implemented,\\\\\" he said.The Army, Rawat said, is developing a mobile application Arpaan to benefit the soldiers, the officers the JCOs and their families in reaching out to various fora and coming out with their problems and seeking answers to it.\\\\\"If we are creating our own apps then how can we deny the usage of smartphones to our soldiers. Smartphones are here to stay. We must learn to utilise them to our advantage,\\\\\" he said.\",\n    \"geoTags\" : [ {\n      \"longitude\" : 77.4126,\n      \"latitude\" : 23.2599\n    } ],\n    \"concepts\" : [ {\n      \"conceptId\" : \"25453094\",\n      \"spot\" : \"Bipin Rawat\",\n      \"parentContent\" : \"Army personnel can't be denied use of smartphones: Bipin Rawat - Times of India\",\n      \"ontologyTypes\" : [ ],\n      \"dbpediaRef\" : \"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bipin_Rawat\",\n      \"startIndex\" : 51,\n      \"endIndex\" : 62,\n      \"content\" : \"Bipin Rawat\",\n      \"confidence\" : 0.8822,\n      \"geoTagSet\" : [ {\n        \"longitude\" : 77.4126,\n        \"latitude\" : 23.2599\n      } ]\n    }, {\n      \"conceptId\" : \"226804\",\n      \"spot\" : \"Times of India\",\n      \"parentContent\" : \"Army personnel can't be denied use of smartphones: Bipin Rawat - Times of India\",\n      \"ontologyTypes\" : [ \"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Newspaper\", \"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/PeriodicalLiterature\", \"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/WrittenWork\", \"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Work\" ],\n      \"dbpediaRef\" : \"http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Times_of_India\",\n      \"startIndex\" : 65,\n      \"endIndex\" : 79,\n      \"content\" : \"The Times of India\",\n      \"confidence\" : 0.8814,\n      \"geoTagSet\" : [ {\n        \"longitude\" : 77.4126,\n        \"latitude\" : 23.2599\n      } ]\n    } ],\n    \"taxonomies\" : [ ],\n    \"createdBy\" : null,\n    \"createdByLogoUrl\" : null,\n    \"createdByUserId\" : null,\n    \"squillUrl\" : \"http://squill.in/sh/04_09_2018/b9stZf\"\n  }\n}";
